Executives do not immediately need to invest in innovative solutions of tomorrow, but we have a responsibility to be aware of them and knowledgeable. For the past eight months the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Venture and Innovation has worked with the venture capital community across the United States seeking emerging technologies that help match mission needs, get advice, identify trends, and gather information to build a portfolio. 

Based on these experiences, a new inter-agency Venture Capital Advisory Group is established that will familiarize agencies with the venture capital community, increase opportunities to collaborate and help spread the awareness of these programs across the government. 

If you would like to participate in our Venture Capital Advisory Group, co-chaired by Department of Homeland Security's Office of Venture and Innovation team, please email Innovatedhs@hq.dhs.gov and EmergingTech@gsa.gov with "#Venture" in the subject field. At this time, the Venture Capital Advisory Group is mobilizing the federal community and will engage our industry partners as the group gets stood up and focused.
